## Inspiration

In our increasingly online world, we often find ourselves yearning for genuine connections. Chatbots with AI can reply to your messages, but they lack a human touch. CozyChat aims to increase its humanity, build a deeper connection, and offer helpful insights to users based on their MBTI personality type. 

## What it does

CozyChat listens to you, provides emotional support, understands you, and gives you insight to your personality. Moreover, you can choose to connect with other people around the world with the same personality type to talk through similar issues and motivate each other. 

## How we built it

We built CozyChat with **Node.js** and **Amazon Web Services**. We programmed an **AWS Lambda** function that integrates with **DynamoDB** and **indico API**. Finally, we make use of Amazon and indico's in-house natural language processing for **sentiment analysis** and **persona analysis**. 

P.S. our [website](http://cozychat.tech/) is on **.tech**.

## Challenges we ran into

We ran into issues with synchronous POST requests and integration of our Lambda function with AWS DynamoDB save states. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our Alexa Skill works!

## What we learned

We learned to use **DynamoDB**, **JavaScript**, **AWS**, and the importance of **teamwork** and **task division**. Most importantly, we learned that hackathons are **fun**!

## What's next for CozyChat: A Heartwarming Voice Assistant

More machine learning coming for better conversation paths. We want to make each conversation smoother and more personal.
